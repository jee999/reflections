When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
- for team working
- to be able to work from different places
- to share the work with other people

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Because it's better to update github repo with well defined/working version.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Forks is only to copy a repository on github to github. Clone is to copy a repository from any place to local.
Branches is only to localy in the same repository work on a different version of the code that could be merge later.
