When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
- for team working
- to be able to work from different places
- to share the work with other people

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Because it's better to update github repo with well defined/working version.
