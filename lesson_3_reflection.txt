When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
- for team working
- to be able to work from different places
- to share the work with other people

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Because it's better to update github repo with well defined/working version.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Forks is only to copy a repository on github to github. Clone is to copy a repository from any place to local.
Branches is only to localy in the same repository work on a different version of the code that could be merge later.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
it help git to merge when doing git pull.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
Maybe sharing an online space, but in that case when some one update this space either he add to ask every one if he can 
or maybe he would delete some stuffs by not caring. Maybe using mail and sending new version to every one, 
but in that case every one needs to merge the new version, so it's a lot of work.  

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?
When you want to do a pull request on 2 different branches that are not master. In this approach we keep the master branch ok and 
just testing multiple features from different branches.
