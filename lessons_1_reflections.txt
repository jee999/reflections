How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
It's help me debugging much much faster typing errors.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
You can try some idees with in mind that if something wrong happened you can go back to a stable version.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, 
vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
You better controle when you want to save and keep a clean code that is working correctly. Otherwise in an automatically
save, you will have steps with code that you have no idee if it is working or not.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others,
like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
For dev code, files are linked in a way or another, its intended to work together, so all files need to be saved together.
In google doc, each file have no link with other files, so it does not need to save multiple files at the same time.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
use git log to view all steps then use git diff to view differenceses between each steps.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
if you break anything you always can go back to a good step.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
I wana use it for following my code.
